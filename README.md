## 1. Disemvowel(str)
- it's a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

*For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".*

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

## 2. Divisors(integer)
- it's a function that takes an integer n > 1 and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors (except for 1 and the number itself), from smallest to largest. If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' 

## 3.squareDigits(num)
- its's a function that squares every digit of a number and concatenate them.

*For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.*

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
